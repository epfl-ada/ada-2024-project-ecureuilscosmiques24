    "First we are going to count the number of movies per actor per generation which will be our interest variable for representativeness. After the movies are separeted in different dataframes according the generation they belong. Then for each dataset we are going to calculate the propensity score for each line, then we are going to make the mean of the propensity score for each actor, and keep only one feature for each actor in the dataset (so that actor that play multiple times don't have more chance to be choosen than other ones). After that, 350 actors will be match according to their gender so as to delete the biases for each dataset. Finally statistics tests will be made to assess the representativeness of woman and the evolution according to the generations. To know if after taking into account the biases the men are still more represented than women, a t-test is going to be made between the number of movies where women and men play in the matched sample for each generation. Chi2 test are going to be made between generations matched values to know if the distribution of men/women change significantly according to the time. "
